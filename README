###Lucky Name

##Find out if you have a lucky name

Ruby BDD assesment by Brandon Madsen

This program will allow the user to input their first name,
and depending on the letters it will output true if their name is lucky, and
false if their name is unlucky. 

What can you do if your name is lucky? Anything you want! Ask the girl of your
dreams out on a date, and she will say yes...Why? Because you have a lucky 
name. Want to land your dream job?? Well, if you have a lucky name let your
interviewer know and you will be a shoe in! 

What happens if your name is unlucky? Well, my friend luck is not on 
your side. But, it isn't hopeless because you can try your last name, or even
your middle name. If one of your names is lucky you will be alright. If all of
your names are lucky then it is impossible for things to go wrong for you. You
might just be the luckiest person alive. If all of your names are unlucky then
you will be the unluckiest person alive. If this is the case you 
might want to consider legally changing your name to a lucky one. Trust me the
results are real and you will begin to notice them immediately.

Good luck!
